# Fingerprint Recognition using Phase-Based Image Matching for Low Quality Fingerprints

Using phase based information from images helps us achieve highly robust fingerprint recognition for low-quality fingerprint images (due to a variation of environment in which the fingerprints are scanned) <br/>
1. Making use of Poincare Indices, extracted the maximum ridge line curvature points. 
2. Primarily used **Band limited Phase Only Correlation (BLPOC)** measures to find the optimum rotations between test and database images.
